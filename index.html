                    As one of the leading arts institutions in the region, 
                    NAFA upholds the spirit of unbridled creativity and 
                    curiosity. By pushing the boundaries of learning and 
                    providing a platform for artists to collaborate and 
                    create, we continue to inspire generations to express 
                    themselves through bold and impactful works of art.
                    Over the past year, we have continued to cultivate a 
                    community that fosters discourse, drives learning and 
                    encourages co-creation. We also leveraged technology 
                    to find new ways of expression. As we celebrate the 
                    accomplishments of faculty, students, staff and artists 
                    across the region, our commitment remains steadfast: 
                    to empower artists with the courage&nbsp;to&nbsp;create.

                        <p> Continuing from the previous years' sustainability-centred 
                            theme, the 2023 Southeast Asian Arts Forum presented 
                            'Sustainability 2.0: Coding the World That Will Remake 
                            Itself', a two-day hybrid event that highlighted creative 
                            practices working towards harmony between humans and 
                            nature. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The forum saw 11 leading regional artists, designers, 
                            artisans and scholars from a variety of creative and 
                            academic disciplines, come together to examine the 
                            concept of sustainable consumption and production in 
                            their fields. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Particularly memorable was a specially commissioned 
                            performance by Yogyakarta-based object theatre 
                            performing group, Flying Balloons Puppet. By tracing 
                            the lineage of rivers and the communities in the vicinity, 
                            the group drew attention to the intricate, ever-evolving 
                            relationship between man and nature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, in line with the Institute of Southeast Asian 
                            Arts (ISEAA)'s mission of championing practice-based and 
                            practice-led learning, the forum also hosted a zine-making 
                            workshop for NAFA students from the Bachelor of Arts 
                            (Honours) Fine Art programme. The workshop, facilitated 
                            by the Hanoi-based Ba Bau Art Collective, centred 
                            around the theme of space-making. Students were 
                            given the opportunity to examine how responsibility and 
                            sustainability play a part in building communities of the 
                            future, and to put together their findings and responses in 
                            a mini-publication.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, there was also a dialogue session, where artists 
                            explored the past and future of their practices, and shared 
                            innovative ways to create and push boundaries as a 
                            practitioner in Southeast Asia. Ultimately, the forum not 
                            only  showcased the artists' determination to survive, but 
                            also their profound search for harmony between humans 
                            and our surrounding ecology.

                        <p> The inaugural Arts & Design Practice Research Exchange 
                            (ADPRex) is Southeast Asia's first annual conference 
                            dedicated to practice research. Held on 27 July 2023, it 
                            saw NAFA's faculty come together to exchange insights 
                            uncovered through various arts and design practices, and 
                            share their visions for the future.

                        <p> Keynote speaker, Associate Professor (now Professor) 
                            Jesvin Yeo Puay Hwa from Nanyang Technological 
                            University, delivered a compelling presentation on 'Driving 
                            Meaningful Social Change Through Creative Research'. This 
                            highlighted the possibilities of combining creativity and 
                            research to address complex societal challenges, explore 
                            artistic making, inspire empathy and action, and challenge 
                            the status quo.

                        <p>Another keynote speaker, Dr Diana Salazar from Royal 
                            College of Music (RCM), London offered an equally 
                            inspiring presentation on 'Towards a Practice Research 
                            Ecology: Radical Listening in the Conservatoire'. Dr Salazar 
                            showcased how RCM, rooted in late 19<sup>th</sup> century classical 
                            music, is evolving through new discourses, practices and 
                            technologies—illustrating how research, once historically 
                            overlooked, now forms a central part of RCM's identity.

                        <p>
                            This significant milestone positions NAFA as the leading 
    centre of arts and design practice research in the region. It 
    also underscores our commitment to shaping the future of 
    arts and design practice research, and fostering a dynamic 
    community of innovative thinkers and practitioners.

                            Challenge Gold (winner). The adrenaline-pumping 
                            challenge, presented by foodpanda, pushed teams of two 
                            to five participants to their creative limits with a 48-hour 
                            deadline to solve a brief. Evaluated on design, feasibility, 
                            creativity, presentation skills and more, our students' 
                            remarkable achievement underscores the rigorous training 
                            embedded in NAFA's curriculum, which equips them with 
                            critical skills and the ability to excel under pressure.

                        <p>In 2023, Singapore's national water agency, PUB, launched 
                            the 'Living with the Rising Seas' Ideas Competition. They 
                            invited local tertiary students to propose innovative 
                            ideas that can protect the South-eastern coastline of 
                            Singapore from rising sea levels while still achieving 
                            liveability, flexibility and sustainability. NAFA's Year 3 3D 
                            Design students from Diploma in Design (Landscape and 
                            Architecture) rose to the challenge and worked on the brief

                        </p>
                        <p>The competition garnered 32 entries from eight tertiary 
                            institutions. Of the nine winning entries, four were from 
                            NAFA in the Urban Promenade, and Nature-centred 
                            Coastline typologies. The innovative ideas and concepts 
                            generated may potentially influence PUB's future measures 
                            for coastal protection, thereby leveraging the creativity of 
                            the younger generation in tackling real-world challenges.

                        <p> XEM is a group of visual artists based in Saigon, founded 
                            by five Vietnamese multidisciplinary artists, Nguyễn 
                            Thanh Trúc, Quang Lâm, Phan Quang, Hoàng Dương Cầm 
                            and Ưu Đàm Trần Nguyễn. XEM's experimental practices 
                            have led to the creation of videos, photographs, digital 
                            games, and installations—all of which advocate for 
                            sustainability by remaining responsive and adaptable to 
                            evolving socio-economic and cultural contexts. United by 
                            shared ideologies, aesthetics and beliefs, the works of 
                            XEM symbolise how hopes and dreams can manifest in 
                            contemporary times and everyday life.

                        <p><i>XEMX: 5 Friends 10 Years Art Infinite </i>was held in

                            academic schools to increase students' exposure to 
                            Southeast Asian art practices. For example, students 
                            participated in an Art Clinic and used the XEM exhibition as 
                            research material. They were also encouraged to explore 
                            what 'collective' means in contemporary Southeast Asian 
                            Arts discourse, and question the relevance of community 
                            and globalisation in our fractured times. Following this, 
                            they presented their findings and responses before XEM 
                            and their peers at the galleries.

                            individual artists and as a collective. XEM also articulated 
                            their intentions and thoughts on diversity pertaining to 
                            Vietnamese culture. The students learnt about challenges 
                            faced by artists as they strive for social and creative 
                            growth, and had a chance to participate in an exchange 
                            with others who share similar interests and values with 
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p><i>XEMX: 5 Friends 10 Years Art Infinite</i> promoted vitality and 
                            diversity in art practice, serving as a foundation for young, 
                            aspiring artists to boldly kickstart their experimental art 
                            journey.

                            Hospice, was designed to facilitate deep cross-disciplinary

                        </p>
                        <p>The third edition of the project fostered appreciation for 
                            healthcare practices, and raised awareness of topics 
                            relating to vulnerable communities, palliative and broader 
                            notions of care. It also encouraged contemplation on what

                            social workers and pastoral carers. Together, they co-created a collection of artworks based on these stories. 
                            The work was displayed at the hospice as well as a public 
                            exhibition—advocating for art's place in non-art settings 
                            and the value of peer-sharing.

            <p> Testament to the exceptional talent and creativity of 
                of NAFA's students, the School of Fashion Studies was 
                invited to participate in Lao Fashion Week 2023, the most 
                prestigious international fashion gathering in Laos which 
                sees participation from designers all around Southeast 
                Asia. Three standout outfits from the graduation collections 
                of 2023 Diploma in Fashion Design graduates, Chua Jia 
                Ling and Quek Yu Tong, were presented at the event. 
            </p>
            <p>Chua's <i>Anatomy</i> collection, inspired by the intricacies of 
                the human anatomy, was tailored for the Spring/Summer 
                2024 season. The collection featured precise, well-fitted 
                silhouettes that reflect the structural integrity of the body, 
                alongside flowy pieces that capture the fluidity and natural 
                motion of the human body.   
                </p>
            <p>Quek's <i>Saccharine Rush</i> collection, designed for Spring/Summer 
                2024, drew inspiration from the adrenaline rush. 
               It captured the sweetness, sentimentality and nostalgia 
               that one might experience during moments of excitement, 
               fun, receiving undying love, or even having a good dream.

                display of musical excellence at the NAFA 85<sup>th</sup> Anniversary 
                Celebration Concert. The concert was held on 8 April 
                2023 at the Victoria Concert Hall, and supported by the 
                Singapore Symphony Orchestra. 
            </p>
            <p>SOM opened the event with the world premiere of a 
                specially-commissioned work by Head of Composition 
                at SOM, Dr Zechariah Goh, recipient of the 2014 NAFA 
                Distinguished Alumni Medal and 2003 National Arts 
                Council's Young Artist Award.    
                </p>
            <p>Led by Artistic Director, Maestro Lim Yau and in partnership 
                with The Philharmonic Orchestra Singapore, the NAFA 
                Orchestra then presented Prokofiev's <i>Symphony No. 5</i>, 
                a piece described by esteemed conductor Serge 
                Koussevitzky in the November 1945 <i>Time</i> magazine as “the 
                greatest musical event in many, many years”. Zhu Zunzun, 
                Grand Prize Winner of the NAFA Concerto Competition 
                2022/2023, played the soloist in Prokofiev's lyrical and 
                virtuosic <i>Violin Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 63</i>.
            </p>

            <p>This concert highlighted the artistic sensitivities and 
                technical competencies of NAFA's students, faculty 
                members and alumni, marking a significant milestone in 
                NAFA's illustrious history.

        <h2>Crossings</h2>
        <p>Crossings is an annual celebration of Singapore's emerging 
            dance talents. The 2023 edition, held on 12 and 13 May, 
            offered a diverse showcase of dance works featuring  
            distinguished  local  and international guest choreographers.
        </p>
        <p>Jacky Yu from Hong Kong mesmerised the audience with 
            his high level of individualism and fluidity  of contemporary 
            movement language in <i>Lights Up 15</i> , while Gillian Tan 
            from Singapore expertly put together music, dance and 
            fashion for a stunning display of <i>In Transition</i>. Shahrin 
            Johry from Singapore restaged <i>Belladonna NightShade</i>,
             a contemporary piece with roots in Bharathanatyam and 
            street; and Jeffrey Tan, also from Singapore, revisited the 
            excerpt <i>Amalgamation</i>—a piece that managed to challenge 
            the dancers' movement vocabulary while retaining the 
            strength and beauty of classical ballet.   
            </p>
        <p>The repertoire of performances underscored the edge 
            and versatility of NAFA's dancers, cementing our status 
            in Southeast Asia as a leader in conservatory-styled 
            programmes with a contemporary outlook.

        <h2>My Art, Our Voices</h2>
        <p> NAFA's Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Performance Making 
            Year 1 students and Interdisciplinary Project diploma 
            students presented <i>My Art, Our Voices</i> as a performative 
            response to the large-scale exhibition <i>Tropical: Stories 
                from Southeast Asia and Latin America</i> at National Gallery 
            Singapore. Inspired by the exhibition's themes such as   
            'The Myth of the Lazy Native', 'This Earth of Mankind', and 
            'The Subversive', the compelling performance opened 
            with the manifesto “My Art, 'Art of Liberation'” by Semsar 
            Siahaan (Jakarta,1988). It continued with a non-linear 
            journey through traditional and contemporary realms, 
            showcasing beautiful, confident, post-colonial reclaimed 
            identities through movement, dance, text, moving images 
            and sound.

    <h2>Walk With Me</h2>
    <p><i>Walk With Me</i> was an immersive installation that encouraged visitors to take a break from the hustle of daily life and 
        embrace the present moment. Held in conjunction with Singapore Night Festival 2023, the installation leveraged visual, 
        sound and motion detection technology to trigger vibrant colours and audio effects as visitors passed. The unexpected 
        twist captured their attention, prompting them to take a breather and rediscover a sense of childlike wonder.  
    </p>
    <p>The installation design was developed by Dayn Ng, sound artist and NAFA alumnus, and Iskander Abori, Programme 
        Leader (Projects & Outreach), Faculty of Interdisciplinary Practices. Graphic design was by Bachelor of Arts (Honours) 
        Design Practice student, Oh Jun Wei.
    </p>
    
    <!-- <p>The repertoire of performances underscored the edge 
        and versatility of NAFA's dancers, cementing our status 
        in Southeast Asia as a leader in conservatory-styled 
        programmes with a contemporary outlook.

    <h2>Memories of Jogja: A showcase of NAFA's first Overseas Immersion Programme in Arts Management</h2>
    <p><i>Memories of Jogja</i> showcased works from the first 
        successful Overseas Immersion Programme (OIP) for 
        Arts Management students at Institut Seni Indonesia 
        Yogyakarta (ISI Yogyakarta). Open to all visitors during the 
        NAFA Open House 2024, the exhibition displayed diverse 
        works done by the Year 3 students during and after the OIP, 
        including photographs, videos, batik pieces and postcards. 
        Visitors were also treated to Indonesian snacks 'Tastes 
        of Jogja' and participated in a gamelan interactive activity 
        'Sounds of Jogja'. 
    </p>
   
    <p>The 2023 OIP is significant as it marked the first 
        partnership between ISI Yogyakarta's Arts Management 
        programme (Tata Kelola Seni) and the NAFA School of Arts 
        Management. ISI Yogyakarta's programme is part of their 
        Faculty of Visual Arts and boasts academic staff with strong 
        expertise in visual arts management, archive curation, and 
        traditional arts and artifact management. 
    </p>

    <p>Our Arts Management students benefited from insightful 
        lectures and workshops. The lecture, 'Volunteerism and 
        the Jogja Biennale', which detailed the development of 
        volunteer programmes was noteworthy as it aligned with 
        NAFA's efforts to encourage volunteerism among students. 
        All in all, the enriching experience underscored the 
        significance of international collaboration in broadening our 
        students' educational and cultural horizons.

<h2>NAFA partners SMU for programmes in arts and business</h2>
<p>On 19 May 2023, the NAFA Centre for Lifelong Education 
    (CLE) and SMU Academy signed a Memorandum of 
    Understanding to develop and offer the SMU-NAFA 
    Advanced Certificate in Arts Management for Arts 
    Professionals, and the SMU-NAFA Advanced Certificate in 
    Mastering Design Literacy for Marketing programmes. This 
    collaboration is significant as it marks NAFA CLE’s entry 
    into the corporate training market. It also reaffirms our 
    position in the Continuing Education and Training (CET) 
    sector. By leveraging the expertise of NAFA and SMU, 
    these programmes will empower learners with unique 
    perspectives needed to enhance their professional practice 
    in marketing and arts management. We are confident this 
    partnership will bring together the arts and business, to 
    enrich both lives and communities through education and 
    practice.

    <h2>JA Art Carnival 2023</h2>
    <p>From 6 to 8 October 2023, NAFA's campus grounds were 
        transformed into a vibrant platform of creativity for Junior 
        Art's biennial Art Carnival. Excitement filled the carnival 
        as students and the public alike tried their hands at a 
        myriad of art and craft activities, all designed to elicit one's 
        imagination and spark joy. Highlights of the event included 
        interactive stations for participants to unleash their inner 
        artist, and free popcorn to celebrate Children's Day 2023. 
        The carnival was a joyous celebration of artistic expression 
        and community spirit, making it an unforgettable event for 
        everyone involved.

            <h2>Junior Drama student's work shines on Spotify, radio and film</h2>
            <p> At just 11 years old, Junior Drama Performance Ensemble 
                student Aurvi Jain launched her first podcast. Her work 
                was inspired by the Communication Skills class she took in 
                2023, where she achieved a high Distinction in her Trinity 
                Grade 5 Communication Skills examinations.
            </p>

            <p>During her time in class, Jain researched on environmental 
                and animal protection. She also dived deep into the impact 
                our behaviour has on the earth. Motivated to do more for 
                our environment, she developed a podcast to share her 
                views. 
            </p>

            <p>Jain's podcast episode aired on Spotify and was featured 
                on Money FM 89.3 on 1 March 2024. She also completed 
                a film project with Damon Gameau, an Australian actor, 
                director and producer known for the documentaries 
                <i>That Sugar Film</i> and 2040. Their collaboration, set to 
                be released later in 2024, signifies Jain's commitment 
                to making a positive difference through her creative 
                endeavours.

            <p>The annual Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) 
                aims to promote Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) by 
                sharing best practices for teaching and learning. Organised 
                by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Committee to 
                Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Malay 
                Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) and 
                the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee 
                (TLLPC), the symposium is targetted at educators at 
                preschool and lower primary levels, as well as parents with 
                young children. 
            </p>
          
            <p>In 2023, the NAFA Arts Preschool (APS) was invited 
                by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to 
                participate and showcase our Chinese curriculum. We 
                presented our innovative teaching approach, including the 
                Project Approach for Chinese language, and shared a range 
                of reading materials and resources designed to enrich 
                language learning. Encouraged by the reception to our 
                Mulan-inspired performance in 2022, we also explained 
                how we integrated traditional folktales into various art 
                forms to enhance learning experiences. To further engage 
                our audience, we planned interactive Mandarin games, to 
                create an immersive and educational experience for all. 
            </p>

            <p>Response was overwhelmingly positive. Supportive 
                APS parents visited our booth at the Suntec Singapore 
                Convention & Exhibition Centre. Numerous parents 
                also expressed interest in our distinctive curriculum 
                and approach. We are honoured to have this invaluable 
                opportunity to foster a love for the Chinese language and 
                culture.</p>

            Cultural Medallion recipient Han Sai Por, Tay Bak Chiang, 
            Boo Sze Yang and more.
        </p>

        <p> With the generous support of our patrons and donors, we 
            raised more than S$1.2 million for the NAFA Development 
            Fund, which will further the academy's mission of inspiring 
            learning and growth through the arts.

        <h2>85 Years in 85 Minutes Concert</h2>
        <p> In commemoration of NAFA's 85<sup>th</sup> anniversary, the NAFA 
            Music Alumni Chapter and Alumni Relations Office, came 
            together with Voices of Singapore to present an energetic 
            and dynamic concert showcasing the academy's musical 
            talents spanning from the 1980s to 2023.
        </p>
      
        <p> Past music alumni scholars were invited to contribute, 
            and together with the generous support of the NAFA 
            Collaborative Lab Grant, the unique event successfully 
            intertwined live performances with nostalgic campus 
            stories. This allowed the NAFA community to reminisce 
            about their post-graduation journeys and celebrate the 
            profound impact alumni have had both on campus, and in 
            the wider community.
        </p>

        <p> The 85-minute concert, the first of its kind since the NAFA 
            School of Music (SOM) was established in 1984, was held 
            at the prestigious CHIJMES Hall on 6 September 2023. 
            Nearly 200 SOM faculty, alumni and students attended. 
            176 tickets were sold, surpassing the initial plan of 150 
            seats. The proceeds of S$6,400, raised from ticket sales, 
            donations and ad purchases, were donated to the NAFA 
            Education Fund. The event was a heartfelt celebration 
            of musical excellence and camaraderie, highlighting the 
            enduring legacy and the vibrant future of NAFA's
             musical community.

        <h2>NAFA Convocation 2023</h2>
        <p>On 28 and 29 September, we celebrated the achievements 
            of 751 graduates from the Class of 2023. Held at the 
            Lee Foundation Theatre, the convocation was graced by 
            Guest of Honour Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman, Minister, 
            Prime Minister’s Office, Second Minister for Education and 
            Foreign Affairs. It was attended by over 1,100 family and 
            friends of graduates. 
        </p>

        <p>Within the graduates were the pioneering cohorts from our 
            programmes with both the University of the Arts London 
            and the Royal College of Music’s Bachelor of Education 
            (Honours) in Instrumental & Vocal Teaching. Additionally, 
            the first batch of students from our NAFA Foundation 
            Programme graduated from the diploma programmes.
        </p>

        <p> At the convocation, NAFA presented the Distinguished 
            Alumni Medal to Isyana Sarasvati, one of Indonesia’s most 
            influential female musicians and a NAFA alumna who 
            completed her Diploma in Music in 2013 and Bachelor of 
            Music (Honours) in 2015. Various accolades  were also 
            presented to outstanding graduates who exemplify NAFA’s 
            core values of creativity, exploration and resilience. These 
            included the Embassy of Peru Award, The Ngee Ann Kongsi 
            Gold Medal, NAFA Chairman Award, NAFA President 
            Award, and the Wu Tsung Kan Book Prize.
        </p>

        <p> To date, over 19,000 artists and creatives have graduated 
            from NAFA and gone on to contribute significantly to the 
            arts landscape both in Singapore and beyond.

        <h2>A warm welcome to the AY2023/2024 intake</h2>
        <p> Orientation for the AY2023/2024 diploma students was 
            held between 31 July and 4 August 2023. During this time, 
            students attended online briefings on student support 
            services held by the Offices of Student Affairs, Student 
            Care, Information Technology, and EdTech.
        </p>
      
        <p> In addition, students were invited on campus for a 
            welcome address by NAFA President, Mrs Tan-Soh Wai 
            Lan, to meet the faculty, and to participate in activities 
            organised by each school. Student Leaders also led 
            campus tours for new students to familiarise themselves 
            with the campus facilities. The orientation effectively 
            combined information, inspiration and interaction, ensuring 
            a successful onboarding experience for the students at 
            NAFA.

                    The last decade has seen NAFA ride the waves of 
                    change and emerge triumphant. We have integrated

                            <p> Nearing the end of our previous 10-Year Strategic Plan, 
                                NAFA took into account the considerable internal and 
                                external developments and began working on our strategy 
                                for the next era in 'NAFA100 Strategic Vision Masterplan', 
                                a strategic masterplan anchored in our vision, mission and 
                                core values. It outlines four strategic priorities: Academic 
                                Alchemy, Courage to Create, Empathy, and the SEA Arts 
                                Dimension for the academy to stride towards its centennial 
                                anniversary in 2038. 
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Academic Alchemy</strong> will see NAFA provide a transformative,
                                creative education focused on mastery of practice and 
                               lifelong learning. Our students are already globally sought
                               after  for their  creative talents, resilience and leadership.  
                               In the future, we will continue developing partnerships as 
                               part of an International Engagement Strategy, so we may 
                               elevate international collaborations and promote further 
                               research and knowledge exchange.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Courage to Create</strong> entails nurturing a culture of innovation 
                                and enterprise. Besides encouraging our community to 
                                lead in arts, education and workplace practices, we will 
                                also highlight the importance of respecting heritage while 
                                championing innovation. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Empathy</strong> focuses on programmes and partnerships to 
                                effect positive social impact. The quality of empathy in a 
                                hyper-connected world empowers artists and creatives to 
                                make a positive impact through the intrinsic value of arts 
                                and design. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Finally, the <strong>SEA Arts Dimension</strong> establishes NAFA as 
                                a beacon and gateway for Southeast Asian (SEA) Arts. 
                                Through our Institute of Southeast Asian Arts and other 
                                resources such as the Living Archive of Contemporary 
                                Asian Art, we will expand our sphere of influence in the 
                                region, and attain a global reputation as a thought leader in 
                                SEA arts.
                            </p>
                            <p> These strategic priorities span academic, cultural and 
                                social dimensions, and underscore NAFA's dedication 
                                to employing a holistic educational approach. With them 
                                in place, we aim to deliver transformative educational 
                                experiences, cultivate an innovative culture, foster empathy 
                                and social impact—ultimately solidifying our position as a
